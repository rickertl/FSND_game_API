##Game Description:
Hangman is a guessing game. Each game begins with a random 'target' word with
'x' number of letter spaces to spell a word. Letter 'guesses' are sent to the `make_move` 
endpoint which will reply with either: 'good guess', 'bad guess', 'you win', or 'you lose'
(if the maximum number of attempts is reached). Many different Hangman games can be played 
by many different Users at any given time. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the 
path parameter `urlsafe_game_key`.
